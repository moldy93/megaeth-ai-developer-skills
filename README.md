# MegaETH Developer Skill for AI Agents

A comprehensive skill for AI coding agents (Claude Code, OpenClaw, Codex) to build real-time applications on MegaETH, with explicit MegaEVM/spec-version awareness.

## Overview

This skill provides AI agents with deep knowledge of the MegaETH development ecosystem:

- **Transactions**: `eth_sendRawTransactionSync` (EIP-7966) for low-latency synchronous receipt return without polling
- **RPC Patterns**: JSON-RPC batching, WebSocket keepalive, mini-block subscriptions
- **Storage**: Optimization patterns to avoid expensive SSTORE costs
- **Gas Model**: MegaEVM-specific costs and estimation strategies
- **Debugging**: mega-evme CLI for transaction replay and gas profiling
- **Security**: MegaETH-specific considerations and audit checklists
- **Meridian**: x402 payments on MegaETH for seller/server and buyer/agent flows
- **MegaNames**: .mega naming service — registration, resolution, subdomains, subdomain marketplace
- **VRF / Randomness**: drand quicknet verifier integration for lotteries, reveals, and game mechanics

## Usage

Once installed, your AI agent will automatically use this skill when you ask about:

- Building dApps on MegaETH
- Transaction submission and confirmation
- Smart contract development with MegaEVM
- Storage optimization and gas costs
- Real-time WebSocket subscriptions
- Debugging failed transactions
- Replaying or locally debugging MegaETH transactions with mega-evme
- Understanding when to use Foundry vs mega-evme for diagnosis

### Example Prompts

```
"Set up a wallet for MegaETH"
"Send 0.1 ETH on MegaETH"
"Swap USDM for ETH on MegaETH"
"Bridge ETH from Ethereum to MegaETH"
"Set up a Next.js app with MegaETH wallet connection"
"Deploy a contract to MegaETH with Foundry"
"Why is my transaction using so much gas?"
"How do I subscribe to real-time mini-blocks?"
"Optimize this contract for MegaETH storage costs"
"Debug this failed transaction on MegaETH"
"Set up ERC-7710 delegations and scoped permissions"
"Create a MetaMask Smart Account on MegaETH"
"Set up spending limits and time-bound permissions"
"Implement redelegation chains"
"Build a lottery or reveal flow with drand VRF on MegaETH"
"How should I safely integrate randomness on MegaETH?"
"Protect an API route with Meridian on MegaETH"
"Set up a buyer agent to pay with USDm through Meridian"
"Register a .mega name and resolve it"
"Set up subdomain sales with token gating"
"Integrate MegaNames resolution into my dApp"
```

### Which file should an agent read?

- `testing.md` → broad testing, Foundry workflows, common troubleshooting
- `mega-evme.md` → local replay, trace analysis, spec-aware MegaEVM debugging
- `smart-contracts.md` → contract design constraints, system contracts, volatile data behavior

## Key Concepts

### Synchronous Transaction Receipts

MegaETH supports `eth_sendRawTransactionSync` (EIP-7966), which enables low-latency synchronous receipt return instead of requiring a separate polling loop:

```typescript
const receipt = await client.request({
  method: 'eth_sendRawTransactionSync',
  params: [signedTx]
});
// Receipt returned in the same RPC flow
```

### Spec Awareness

MegaETH behavior is spec-versioned through `REX5`, and not every new MegaEVM behavior is necessarily active on every network yet. Agents should avoid assuming unstable spec behavior (for example REX5 system-contract changes) is live unless the user explicitly asks about current unstable behavior or local node state.

### Storage Costs

New storage slots are expensive (2M+ gas). The skill teaches agents to:
- Use Solady's RedBlackTreeLib instead of mappings
- Design for slot reuse
- Consider off-chain storage for large data

### Gas Model

MegaETH has a stable 0.001 gwei base fee with no EIP-1559 adjustment. The skill teaches agents to:
- Skip unnecessary gas estimation
- Use remote estimation (MegaEVM costs differ from standard EVM)
- Hardcode gas limits for known operations

## Chain Configuration

| Network | Chain ID | RPC | Explorer |
|---------|----------|-----|----------|
| Mainnet | 4326 | `https://mainnet.megaeth.com/rpc` | `https://mega.etherscan.io` |
| Testnet | 6343 | `https://carrot.megaeth.com/rpc` | `https://megaeth-testnet-v2.blockscout.com` |

## Progressive Disclosure

The skill uses progressive disclosure — the main SKILL.md provides core guidance, and the agent reads specialized files only when needed for specific tasks. This keeps context efficient while providing deep expertise when required.
